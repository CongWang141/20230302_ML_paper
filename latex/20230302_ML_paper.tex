\title{Multi-Measure Stock Return Prediction Using Neural Network Models\thanks{abc}}

\begin{abstract}
\noindent This study uses a feed-forward neural network model to predict different measures of stock returns in the US market. The results demonstrate that the model performs similarly well in predicting various measures of stock returns using only stock characteristic variables. However, adding macroeconomic variables significantly enhances the model's predictive accuracy for stock excess returns, in comparison, the improvements for predicting stock abnormal returns are not so significant. Furthermore, the study evaluates the performance of prediction-based portfolios under diverse macroeconomic conditions and finds that they perform better in volatile markets during recession periods. These findings suggest that incorporating macroeconomic data and adjusting portfolios based on macroeconomic conditions can lead to more effective investment strategies.\\
